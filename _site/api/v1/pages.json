{"entries":[{"title":"Welcome to Trailmap.","url":"/about/","tags":[],"body":"Who made this map? This map was created by MAPC with contributions from cities, towns, state agencies, land trusts, other organizations, and individuals. This map is updated on a regular basis, incorporating new data and corrections. However, Data gaps exist, particularly with walking trails. What is the data on this map? Walking Facilities - include hiking trails in conservation lands, paths through campuses, institutions, city parks, and other pedestrian facilities that are not along roadways. Bicycle Facilities – includes on-road designated facilities including bicycle lanes, shared lane markings, cycle tracks, and select on-road connections. Shared Use Paths – includes trails on former railroad rights-of-way, rivers, and other corridors which are designed for shared use by cyclists, walkers, and other nonmotorized transport. Improved paths are either paved, or with a stabilized firm surface, ideal for use by road bicycles, wheelchairs, strollers etc. Unimproved paths have a rough surface, and are therefore generally limited to hiking and mountain biking uses. Regional Networks – includes linear corridors that have been signed or otherwise designated. Walking trails include the Bay Circuit, Charles River Link, Warner Trail, Western Greenway, and proposed Metrowest aqueduct trail system. Bicycle routes include the East Coast Greenway and the Claire Saltonstall Bikeway."},{"title":"Biking","url":"/tiles/biking/","tags":[],"body":""}]}
